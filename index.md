This is a wearable head designed for fans of cosplay (costume play) that want an interactive costume. The eyelids just above the robot's eyes are able to move up and down, demonstrating that the robot is angry. This is triggered by the user tilting their head forward or by bowing. When this is worn at conventions and other gathering, it will grab a lot of attention and make for a fun experience for everyone around.
