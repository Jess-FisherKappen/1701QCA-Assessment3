<!--- When you have completed the template, submit the link to the GitHub Pages site for this repository as a link in Learning@Griffith. The link should be something like [https://qcainteractivemedia.github.io/1701QCA-Assessment3/](https://qcainteractivemedia.github.io/1701QCA-Assessment3/) where `qcainteractivemedia` is replaced with your GitHub username and `1701QCA-Assessment3` is replaced with whatever you called the repository this template is contained in when you set it up. You should NOT be submitting a link that begins with github.com/[your user name] as that is not the rendered version. See the instructions about creating GitHub pages to see how to get the link to the rendered page. --->

<!--- SHOWCASE IMAGE: Insert a showcase image here. Try to capture the image as if it were in a portfolio, sales material, or project proposal. The project isn't likely to be something that finished, but practice making images that capture the project in that style. 

The image should be inserted with code like that below where you replace the filename to exactly match what you uploaded. The image must be in .jpg, .gif, .png format. Files of .heic or .heif type will not show up. Note that .png is different to .PNG in a filename here. The names are case sensitive.

<!--- PROJECT DESCRIPTION: In a few sentences, describe what the project is and does, who it is for, and a typical use case. This should be suitable for a catalog, poster, or other display material about the project. --->
This is a wearable head designed for fans of cosplay (costume play) that want an interactive costume. The eyelids just above the robot's eyes are able to move up and down, demonstrating that the robot is angry.  

<!--- SECONDARY IMAGE: Provide some other image that gives a viewer a different perspective on the project such as more about how it functions, the project in use, or something else. This should not just be a different angle of the same object. It should show the project in use if the first image didn't show that, or somehow tell us a different story about the project. --->

<!--- PROJECT VIDEO: Provide a still image from your video and a link to the video below. In that code, replace `missingimage.png` with the still from your video and the URL of the video where indicated. If you link to a password protected video, you must include the password in the document you submit through Learning@Griffith. Failing to have a video that we can access might lead to significant reduction in marks, potentially as much as if the video has not been submitted at all. --->
